I'm still growing my [Sales as a Service business](https://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/sales-as-a-service.77665/)

I moved my focus away from the German market and have been very fortunate to find an amazing partner for the Americas. I'm also thinking about getting a 'normal' sales job on a part time basis. I mean, I know how to sell, but apart from that I've no idea what I'm doing. I could learn how real professionals go about conducting their business while helping them grow in the process. Ryan calls this the [Canvas Strategy](https://ryanholiday.net/the-canvas-strategy) and does a good job of explaining my reasoning.

I moved back in with my parents by the way. At least for a few weeks. I have access to a proper Desktop PC while I'm here, and I'm looking forward to catching up with all the amazing games that have been released over the past year. I've also been drawing a lot with my second cousin (3yrs). Granted, I can neither draw nor paint, but it's a very enjoyable activity nonetheless.

Saw [Elon's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdUX3ypDVwI) at the International Astronautical Congress earlier today. I always thought that I wouldn't live to see a human traveling to Mars, but it might be happening after all. Already brimming with excitement. 

Anyway, I think I'm gonna go through and apply for a few sales positions. Already got a couple of people in mind I'd love to work for. Further, I want to build a treehouse in my parent's backyard. Can't say we need one, but I really want a treehouse. I'll let you know how it goes.
