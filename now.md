I'm still growing my [Sales as a Service business](hhttps://www.thefastlaneforum.com/community/threads/sales-as-a-service.77665/page-2#post-712893)

Fortune has been very kind to me in that I can make a good living selling websites. But I'm ready for a new challenge. As you know, I've been thinking about getting more involved with both Enterprise Sales and Crypto for a while now. So I've decided to send out a handful of applications. Not sure what area I'll end up in, but in an ideal world I'll soon be part of an ambitious team of people to grow and build something together with. 

In other news: I moved back in with my parents. At least for a few weeks. I have access to a proper Desktop PC while I'm here, and I'm looking forward to catching up with all the amazing games that have been released over the past 18 months. I've also been drawing a lot with my second cousin (4yrs). Granted, I can neither draw nor paint, but it's a very enjoyable activity nonetheless.

Saw [Elon's presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdUX3ypDVwI) at the International Astronautical Congress earlier today. I always thought that I wouldn't live to see a human traveling to Mars, but it might be happening after all. Already brimming with excitement!

Lastly, I want to build a treehouse in my parent's backyard. Can't say we need one, but I really want a treehouse. I'll let you know how it goes.
